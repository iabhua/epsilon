# Delta

Delta is a collection of changes made by Damien Nicolet and Bernard Parisse in Epsilon to port the Giac/Xcas CAS on the NumWorks. Damien authored all the changes required to run newlib instead of liba, build separate firmwares on the device and maintain changes synchronized with NumWorks repository. Most of the changes made by B. Parisse are in the files python/port/port.cpp and python/port/mod/kandinsky/modkandinsky.cpp (C SDK). On other files, a few changes were made, mostly to make public some methods that were protected or private. For more information on how to compile and use the C SDK, open [KhiCAS documentation](https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~parisse/numworks/khicasnw.html).
